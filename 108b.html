Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs,
Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne.[16] The company's first product is the
Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak,[17][18]
and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[19][20]
Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, RAM, and basic textualvideo
chips)—a base kit concept which would now not be marketed as a
complete personal computer
Apple Computer, Inc. was incorporated on January 3, 1977,[28][29] without
Wayne, who had left and sold his share of the company back to Jobs and
Wozniak for $800 only twelve days after having co-founded Apple.[30][31]
Multimillionaire Mike Markkula provided essential business expertise and
funding of $250,000 during the incorporation of Apple.
